    "\n",
    "![](https://cblevins.github.io/f21-data/assets/image/music-chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this chart, we would need to know the year that each album was released, and we would need to aggregate the years by decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for getting the album release year information would be to programmatically extract this information from the web, such as from Genius.com web pages (pictured below) — in other words, to write a Python script that would automatically extract this information. \n",
    "  \n",
    "![](https://cblevins.github.io/f21-data/assets/image/Purple-Rain-Prince.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when extracting data from the web, you need to extract whole sections of the web page, such as `'Released June 25, 1984'` rather than just `'1984'`, which means that we have to do further manipulations with Python in order to get the text in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this homework assignment picks up at this point in the imagined project. We figured out how to extract a specific section of Genius album web pages, but now we need to clean and manipulate the data to extract the 4-digit years from all of these examples and then categorize them by decade."

    "- Manually add one extra release date that was not successfully scraped from the website\n",
    "- Iterate through the list `album_years`extract the 4-digit year from each item in the list, and then categorize each release year into decades."
