A hazy morn. I left mr Partridge*s, his Child a little revivd. Came home at noon. mrs Dingley Came here to inquire after the Childs welfare. I went into the prison and Saw the irons put on to McCausland*s hands, an aufull Spectacle he is to behold. may God gran#t$ his pardoning mercy for all his offencies and giv us all Sutable reflections; may the Dear Babe be restord to health and its Parents make a wise improvment of this Chastisment. at mr Partridge*s. mrs Dingley here.
