title: Coding Homework
---

You will be completing a series of coding homework assignments in order to help you learn how to work with data, primarily using the Python programming language. Each exercise will have you apply the skills you learned in the preceding classes.

## Submission Instructions

Most of your programming in this class will take place within the Jupyter Lab environment, and specifically using files called Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is a document in which you can include programming code interspersed with text, images, and displays of data. For each homework you will download a Jupyter Notebook file (ending in .ipynb) and then complete the questions or tasks within that file. Unless otherwise noted, you will then need to upload **two files** to the corresponding Canvas assignment page. 

The **first** file you need to upload is your completed Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file). This file is a "live" notebook that, if necessary, I can download and then run your code to generate the output from it. This will allow me to muck around and help debug any problems. Unless otherwise specified, use the naming convention `hw-01-yourlastname.ipynb` (ex. `hw-01-blevins.ipynb`).

The **second** file is a "static" HTML file that basically takes a snapshot of your notebook's content and output. This is what I will use to "read" through your assignment in Canvas and give you feedback on it using Speedgrader. If I run into problems I can then consult the .ipynb file you submitted. Generating this HTML file requires a few additional steps:

- Save your notebook!
- In Jupyter Lab go to Run -> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells. This basically wipes your notebook clean by reloading it and then sequentially running through all of your cells. Go through and check to make sure that you don't have any error messages from running any of your cells and that everything is displaying properly. 
- Go to: File -> Export Notebooks as... -> HTML and then save the file in the same folder and with the same filename convention as your .ipynb file (ie. `hw-01-yourlastname.html`)

When you have both files ready to submit, go to the Canvas assignment page and upload the `.ipynb` first and then the `.html` file second.
