I"l<p><strong>COVID-19</strong><br />
This class is taking place under extraordinary circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, CU Denver is requiring all students and faculty to get vaccinated and to wear masks while inside. Depending on how the pandemic progresses, there is a chance that the format or logistics of the course might need to change (ie. temporarily switching to remote learning over Zoom). My goal is to provide you with a valuable learning experience despite these circumstances, and I plan to teach with as much flexibility, resilience, and compassion as I can. I ask you to do the same with your classmates and myself as we navigate this semester together. To that end, please contact me over email if you are experiencing any unforeseen challenges (health, housing situation, family, food security, etc.) that will keep you from learning. I will do my best to work with you to meet those challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Health and Wellness</strong><br />
Every student should prioritize their physical, emotional, and mental health. Any student who is struggling to do so (lacking a safe and stable place to live, having difficulty affording sufficient food to eat every day, facing financial stresses, etc.) is urged to consult the resources listed here: <a href="https://www.ucdenver.edu/student/health-wellness">https://www.ucdenver.edu/student/health-wellness</a>, and in particular the University’s <a href="https://www.ucdenver.edu/counseling-center">Counseling Center</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Community</strong><br />
My goal is to build a strong learning community for all of my students. I expect everyone to treat your fellow classmates and professor with respect: listening attentively, not interrupting, and maintaining a civil discourse. It is my intent to create an environment that respects diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, and culture, etc., and supports a wide array of thoughts, perspectives and experiences. To maintain this learning community, bullying or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Learn each other’s names and, if volunteered, preferred pronoun. Always assume the best intentions in each other. If something was said in class (by anyone, including myself) that made you feel uncomfortable please talk to me about it either directly or through anonymous feedback forms that I will periodically administer in class.</p>

<p>More broadly, the University of Colorado Denver is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working and living environment. The University prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, pregnancy, creed, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, gender identity, gender expression, political philosophy or political affiliation in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or related retaliation. If you have experienced some sort of sexual misconduct or discrimination, please visit the Office of Equity/Title IX web site to understand the resources available to you or contact the Office of Equity/Title IX Coordinator (303-315-2567).</p>

<p><strong>Required Course Material</strong><br />
The course’s assignments, readings, and in-class activities require a functioning computer. Because of this, you will need to <strong>bring a laptop to class with you to class</strong> - please notify me ahead of time if your computer runs into technical glitches and you will be unable to bring it to a particular class. As a matter of principal, I have tried to keep your costs for other kinds of course material to a minimum. Nearly all of the assigned tutorials, textbooks, readings, etc. are available for free and there are no required books or textbooks to purchase. In addition to specific tutorials and thematic readings we will be relying on two “core texts” throughout the semester, both of which are available online.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Melanie Walsh, <em>Introduction to Cultural Analytics &amp; Python</em> (online textbook)</li>
  <li>Catherine D’Ignzaio and Lauren F. Klein, <em>Data Feminism</em> (MIT Press, 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Slack</strong><br />
This is an in-person course, but we will also be using a <a href="http://f21-data.slack.com/">Slack workspace</a> as a backchannel for discussion, to share files, links, etc., and a place to ask for help on assignments outside of class periods. Please join the Slack workspace using the invitation link sent over Canvas.</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours</strong><br />
I will be conducting office hours on Tuesdays, from 10:00-11:00am, in my office in Student Commons Room 3108 unless otherwise stated. Note: if you are not able to attend office hours in person I am more than happy to meet over Zoom. If that time does not work for your schedule, please contact me over email or Slack and we will find a different time to meet. Take advantage of office hours as an opportunity to talk with me about any aspect of the class: the week’s reading, ideas and strategies for upcoming assignments, feedback you have received, or difficult themes and concepts. Or, just drop by and let me know how the rest of your classes, work, etc. are going! I enjoy hearing about what my students are doing and look forward to getting to know each of you.</p>

<p><strong>Late Assignments</strong><br />
If unforeseen circumstances come up during the semester and you need an extension on a particular assignment, please notify me via email or Slack. Otherwise you are expected to submit all assignments by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable Accommodation</strong><br />
I am committed to providing everyone the support and services needed to participate in this course. If you have a learning disability please contact Disability Resources and Services at 303-315-3510 or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:disabilityresources@ucdenver.edu">disabilityresources@ucdenver.edu</a> and, if you are comfortable, notify me directly as well. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, please reach out to Disability Resources and Services.</p>

<p><strong>Students Called for Military Duty</strong><br />
Students in the military with the potential of being called to military service and/or training during the course of the semester are encouraged to notify their school/college Associate Dean or Advising Office.</p>

<p><strong>CLAS Incomplete Policy</strong><br />
The faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences passed the following policy relating to the awarding of incomplete grades.  Incomplete grades (IW or IF) are meant for students with special circumstances beyond their control that preclude them from attending class and completing graded assignments. They are not granted for low academic performance, and students must have completed a majority of the course’s assignments and classes in order to qualify. Incompletes cannot be awarded that stipulate: (1) a student may repeat the entire course, (2) repeat or replace existing grades, (3) allow the student an indeterminate period of time to complete a course, or (4) allow the student to repeat the course with a different instructor. The CLAS Course Completion Agreement is available from the CLAS Advising Office, NC 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Religious Observances</strong><br />
If, because of religious obligations, you have conflicts with required assignments/attendance please email me directly as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong><br />
Students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the university, including rules against plagiarism, cheating, fabrication and falsification, multiple submissions, misuse of academic materials, and complicity in academic dishonesty.</p>
